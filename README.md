# VBA_Challenge

Module 2 Assignment from Alex Lee

The Assignment Sheets show the code that have been run on each sheet - I specified a particular worksheet and and ran the code on that.  For following years, it is the same code except I have changed the worksheet name - so 2018, 2019 and 2020.

Also the screenshots are included, showing the summary data.

I could not upload the Excel file in its entirety because it was too big - even after compressing it.

As this is my real first venture into VBA - other than using the Macro recorder - I did have to read around and practice the subject a fair bit to get a greater grasp!
